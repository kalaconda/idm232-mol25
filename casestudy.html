        <h2>What Is CookingPro?</h2>
        <p> CookingPro is the new rebranded redesign of <a href="https://blueapron.com/" target="_blank">Blue Apron</a>. Blue Apron is a website
        that provides users with cooking recipes and offers to ship it's ingredients right at your doorstep. I wanted to redesign
        Blue Apron to give the website a different layout then it has currently. I felt like the website's current design could present
        itself in a way that users can understand how to find the information they need. </p>
        <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
        <p> Blue Apron is an online cookbook that provides users with recipes. The problem Blue Apron has is that it's design is more 
          traditional and it's unclear where to get started as a user. I wanted to solve this solution by coming up with a new design that fits
          the cookbook theme and reorganizing the website's contents in a way that users can easily find what they are looking for.

        <h2>Process & Insight</h2>
        <!-- style tile -->
        <img src="caseimages/styletile.jpg" class="centeredpics">
        <p class="text2">For the color scheme, I stuck with a mainly green theme since the color green represents outdoors and has a fresh feel to it. I also thought
          incorporating green would be a great way to let users know this website is vegan-friendly.

          <img src="caseimages/wireframe2.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="text2"> In my wireframes, I got rid of the side navigation menu for mobile and decided to layout the menu links in the top header so
          users will knows exactly how to navigate threw all of the pages. I also decided to add a section where featured specials are shown
          on the home page. This is a great way for users to know what recipes are trending or popular. For each recipe, I decided to display
          it as a card where the recipe image, name, calories, and time are displayed.
